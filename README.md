# Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I showcase my deep learning projects focused on natural language processing (NLP). This repository serves as a platform to share my work, explore NLP techniques, and contribute to the ever-evolving field of artificial intelligence.

## Projects

### Multiclass Text Classification using the 20 Newsgroups Dataset

- **Description**: This project involves building and training a transformer-based model to classify texts into one of twenty different categories derived from the 20 Newsgroups dataset. The model utilizes cutting-edge NLP techniques including tokenization, attention mechanisms, and embeddings to understand and categorize text data effectively.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Notebook**: [Multiclass_Text_Classification.ipynb](https://github.com/BahneTP/Deep-Learning-for-NLP/blob/main/mtc-using-a-transformer-decoder.ipynb)

## Future Projects

This repository is expected to grow as I continue to explore more areas within NLP. Future projects might include:

- **Sentiment Analysis**
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
- **Language Model**
